# Azury API Open Source

## This is the full open source version!

Read the licence to understand what you can do and what you can't do with this code!

This source code heavily relies on the API website, which means endpoints aren't manually put inside the source code.

Have any problems or fixes, make a pull or issue!

API KEYS ARE REQUIRED UNLESS COMMAND IS FOR FREE.
